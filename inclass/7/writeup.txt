In computer graphics, a three-dimensional shape is represented as a collection of triangular faces.  The locations of points and the combinations of points which make up each face are specified as input, but sometimes it is necessary to operate on the edges, the places where faces meet.  The silhouette edge is made up of those edges on the boundary between faces which can be seen onscreen and faces which are hidden from view.  When displayed on its own, it appears as the "outline" of a three-dimensional shape.  This is not especially important for photorealistic rendering, but in order to render a cartoonish or cel-shaded art style, generation of the silhouette edge is an important step.
