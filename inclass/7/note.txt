Hey Everybody: 

So far I've only received Lab 7 code from a few groups.  I would really appreciate being able to see code from as many groups as possible.  

Don't worry if you're not proud of your code, I'm just looking broadly at the algorithms used to get a general idea for my report on how many teams used which strategies.  

Sending me your code will not affect your grade in any way, but it will help me finish my Masters Project so I can graduate.  

I would be extremely grateful to as many teams who are able to send me their code today.  

Thank you,
---Paul
